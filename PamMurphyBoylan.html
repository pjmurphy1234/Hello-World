    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I've been married for several years to my husband, Dave. I have four adult kids, and we really enjoy getting together.  We travel 
            together as often as our busy schedules permit. When i'm not working, I enjoy traveling, cooking, reading, and hanging out playing board games with friends 
            and family.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Places I've Traveled</h3>
        <p>My husband is an airline pilot, so we've traveled all over the word, but some of my favorite places include:
            <Ul>
                <li>Italy-particularly the Chianti region!  My daughter lived there for six months; we visited her 
                        and fell in love with the area, food, and people!</li>
                <li>Greece-Santorini is breathtaking.  The history and landcape truly made me feel I went back in time!</li>
                <li>Japan-Kyoto in the springtime when the cherry trees blossom is lovely</li>
                
        <p>There are several more places I truly enjoyed, but too many to list.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Games</h3>
        <p> When our family gets together, our very favorite board game to play is Settlers of Catan.  We are <strong>REALLY</strong>
            competative, but it's all in good fun.  When we want to chill and play something less strategic, we enjoy LCR, Dominos, Charades, Heads Up, and card games.</p>
